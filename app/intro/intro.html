          <h3>The Game</h3>

          The Tetris game contains 7 shapes <b>IJLOSTZ</b>, which can be rotated 0,1,2 or 3 times.


          <h4>Shape I (rotated 0 to 3 times)</h4>
          <div id="shape-demo-I"></div>

          <h4>Shape J (rotated 0 to 3 times)</h4>

          <h4>Shape L (rotated 0 to 3 times)</h4>

          <h2>Input & Output</h2>
          <p>
            You will be given a list of 50 Tetris games (you will know in advance all the shapes in the game in the order they will come).<br>
            You will have to solve each game by specifying the column where to place each shape and rotation to use.<br>
            Your goal is to score the highest score possible by taking advantage of the combo multipliers and planning your moves carefully.<br>
            <br>
            You can solve the game using any programming languages or tools you want.<br>
            The Tetris engine used for scoring is <a href="https://github.com/danmana/tetris/blob/master/tetris.js">provided only in js</a>,
            if you use another language you will have to write your own implementation.
          </p>


          <h3>Data</h3>
          <a class="btn btn-info" href="games.txt" target="_blank">Games Input</a>
          <a class="btn btn-info" href="sample_submission.csv" target="_blank">Sample Submission</a>

          <h4>Games Input</h4>
          <p>The input file contains one game per line. Each character of a line represents a shape (one of
            <b>IJLOSTZ</b>) in the order they will come in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your goal is to place each piece on the Tetris grid and score the highest score possible.
          </p>
          <p>The file will contain a total of 50 games with increasing difficulty.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>LEVEL 0</b> - 10 trivial games of length 30 using 1 or 2 different shapes</li>
            <li><b>LEVEL 1</b> - 10 easy games of length 50 using 3 or 4 different shapes</li>
            <li><b>LEVEL 2</b> - 10 medium games of length 100 using all the 7 shapes</li>
            <li><b>LEVEL 3</b> - 10 hard games of length 1000 using all the 7 shapes</li>
            <li><b>LEVEL 4</b> - 10 extreme games of length 10000 using all the 7 shapes</li>
          </ul>

          Example:
          <pre>
OOOOO
LSTSITS
</pre>

          <br>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            The solution file is a csv with two columns: <b>game</b> and <b>moves</b>.
          </p>

          Example:
          <pre>
game,moves
0,"0:0;2:0;4:0;6:0;8:0"
1,"0:0;2:1;5:0;6:1;8:1;4:2;0:0"
</pre>
          <p>The <b>game</b> column contains the game id: from 0 to 49</p>
          <p>The <b>moves</b> column contains your solution for a game.</p>

          <p>
            A complete solution should have <b>51 lines</b> (1 for the header and 1 for each of the 50 games from the input).
            <br>
            The first line should be the header: <b>game,moves</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The next 50 lines should each be a solution for one game (the order of the games does not matter).
            <br>
            A solution line has two comma separated values: the <b>game id</b> (from 0 to 49) and the <b>moves string</b>.
            <br>
            The csv values can be optionally enclosed in double quotes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The moves string for a game should contain a move pair for each of the shapes in that game.
            <br>
            A move pair is represented as <b>&lt;column&gt;:&lt;rotation&gt;</b> and multiple moves are separated by semicolons.
            <br>
            The <b>column</b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <pre>
// games.txt
OOOOO

//solution.csv

          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            To help you get started we have prepared a sample solution on github:
            <a href="https://github.com/danmana/tetris/tree/master/sample_solution">sample_solution</a>.
            <br>
            You can read more about the sample in the README file on github.
            <br>
            You can also debug your moves or try things in a visual way in the <a href="/#!/simulator">simulator</a>.
